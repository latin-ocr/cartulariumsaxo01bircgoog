In his prefaee, ΜΓ. Thorpe draws largely from Kemble, and
. points out the opportunity he had ol using “a collection ol tran·
ζ scripte ol AugloSaxon Charters, which the late Mr. Petrie had ’
j: caused ιο be made, aud which had long beenlying useless at the
,l Rolls House'' These transcripts,I anr happy to add, have been
ἶ with the greatest kiudncss placed iu my hands sor a time by Sir
1 Willinm Hardy‚ Kch, Deputy Kecper ol the Roils, to whom Ι
fi here desire ιο place on record my sincere thanks
Mr. Thorpe claims to have transcripte ol seventythree un·
printed charters, which may one day serre asa supplement ιο Mr.
Kemble‘s work; but he does not maha it clear whether they are
to be found iu the Diplontctarinm or not. As lar as 1 have carried

ι the work, I have found serv, indeed, that have escaped the notice of
Kemble. The work is closed with a Glossary ol Ternas, and-a very

imperfect, and olttimes incorrect, Iudex ol Places In the Teble ol
ἶ . Contenta, many oi the references to MSS. are misplaced Not· ·
withstanding the lahour which Mn Thorpe, no doubt, devoted ιο
the preparation ol the Diplomalcriann, close examination discloses
¹ ⁴the lact that it is amere compilation from Kemble, with very few
additions, aud os scarcely any critical value · The translation os the
Angla-Saron porticus is certainly a novel feature, aud recommends
the work, no doubt, in sorne qnartcrs Ι arn unwilling to say that
· the work should be hauishcd lrom the shelves ol the library of
un single-Saron student The principal errors and variations oi
Thorpe are recorded in the leot-notes ol this C.tarvuan1vrr,but I
have omitted many ol secoudary character, ιο avoid overloading
the hook nith notes
t We now come ιο the next collection of ,inglu-Saron Charters'
that has been put heloro the world This is conrprehended in the

(1871) ol this work, valuablc both iu its scope and lor its literary
excellence, contains documenta relating ιο the English Church.
during the litigio-Saron period from nu. 595-870. But the
texts ol these are hy no means confined to Charte‘rs only; aud ol

ythc extant charters ol the period, only those which throw

the most part, and it was no part ol the scheme ol the editore
