Mucb might be written upon the obscuro question ol the genuine·
ness ol certain documeuts included in the following pagos, and a
table at the end ol the work will be devoted to the subject Setting
aside lor the moment those which ors glaringly fictitious‚ there are
many which, in their present form, are not truc texts ol original
documeuts‚ lor these originale huwe no doubt perished in some ol tlte
frequent calamities which are so gmphioelly described in many an
ancient chronicle. But leohing on them with the light that many
other genuine deeds oi this period allord, we cannot but be led to the
conclusion thet, although they are not copies, they are reconstrue-
tions ol genuine documents‚ couched in terms dillering lor the most
purt widely from the language ol the original lt is not unlilrely
that these late and spurious lorurs were aet up when necessity
arose lor the existence and productiori ol tho nruuinrents aud
charters which alono could conler upon the cathedral, the abbey,
or the private person, the rights ol possession and the priuileges
long and uselully, as well as legally and unqucstionably, enjoyed

' by such corporation or individuale. Accepting this aiew, that thess

apparently lalse charters are neither originale nor copies ol
originals, but ruere substitutas sor origiunls; not fictitious in tha
sense ol being salse representations; reverendiss, recording real
transactions, yet rrot in the ternrs iu which ¹tho gmnts were
originally made, we can easily understand how it is dat they oon·
tain so many errors ol larignage, history, and topogmphy, and ara
so tull ol anachronisms.
