’ζ It now remains for mc to add a few words explanatory of the
ᾗ] system which has been followed in the printing of this work With
ᾗ, regard to the manner of transcription,lhave endeavoured inallcaees' '

»Α to adhere to the reading of the MS. ao far as punctuation and

.· orthography is concerned. The (ί) which is so frequently found

² in documenta ranging over the entire cycle represented by this

ἑ work, is reproduced here by au inverted semicolon

. The division of words has been earefully considered, and where
' the scribe has incautiously divided a Latin word into two or more

. parts, I have reunited the fragments, because the emor arises from
the fact that the writer was handling a langorage foreign to him, ,.
and in which it was likely that he should occasionally err.

But there are forms of Latin isonls which, froru their widespread
occurrence in every place, show that in them the language was
undergoiug a transit-ional growth—such, for example, as ‘michit

⁴ ‘nichil’, 'puplicus⁸, optinuit, sompnus, ‘dampno', 'reicio’, ‘deicio',
'terminibus', ‘ac'zhac, ‘honeris'=oneris, ¹ gracia’, and other exam·
ples ofc fort. These forms I hare retained

The remarkable irregularities of formation which occasionally are '
met with in the Latin texts are well worthy of notice, and these
have been carefully maintained by me in my transcription A
whole series of abnonnal granuuatical forms and unwouted expres· '

sicus might be gathered without difficulty from the texts of the
following chortem And iturust not be forgotten that incorrect

expressions of language, such as irregular use of tenses, false oon·
corda, wrong cases aiter prepositions, and so forth, in these old Α
deeds, allord valuable criteria by which we can better determine ,
the genuineness of the texts themselves.

ln Aegle-Saron texts the universally occurring separation of the
particle “ge'' seems to point to some principle more deeply oon·
nected with the Angla-Saron langunge than, as some would have
it, the caprices of a few scribcs; and it probably marks an epoch in
the history oi the Anglo·Saxon language. ln the same manner,
dirisions such as ‘big gencgerum' (p. 154) ; ‘god cundan’ (p. 583);
'erfe honda' (p 577), ‘aerfe peerd' (p. 576); and ‘eric pearda'

(p. 576), etc, have been retained
